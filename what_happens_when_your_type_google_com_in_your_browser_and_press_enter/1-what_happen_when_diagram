Explanation:

1)User Input: You type the URL (https://www.google.com) in your browser and press Enter.
2)DNS Lookup: The browser doesn't understand website names, so it sends the URL to a DNS server. The DNS server translates the URL to the actual IP address of the Google server.
3)Secure Connection: The communication between your device and the server is encrypted using SSL/TLS for secure data transfer.
4)Firewall: The firewall acts like a security guard, checking the traffic for any threats before allowing it to reach the server.
5)Load Balancing: If Google has multiple servers, a load balancer distributes the request to an available server to handle the traffic efficiently.
6)Web Server: The web server receives the request and sends back static content like HTML, CSS, and images that make up the basic structure of the web page.
7)Application Server (Optional): Some websites have an application server that generates dynamic content based on your request (e.g., search results). It may also need to retrieve data from a database.
8)Database (Optional): If dynamic content is needed, the application server might query a database to fetch the information.
9)Response: The web server sends the complete web page back to your device.
10)Display: Your browser receives the web page and displays it for you to see.
